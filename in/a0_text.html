    <br><b>Are US Politics At A Pivot Point of Generational Change? (Written In Late 2023)</b><br>

    <p>
       In recent US elections, generational conflict and power transfer have been a topic of
       lively discussion.  These narratives tend to follow a three-point structure.  First,
       narratives assert that people born after World War II ("Boomers") exert a disproportionate
       amount of power over the US economy and polity.  Second, narratives attribute Boomer power
       to different causes, depending on whether the writer views the phenomenon as 
       positive or negative and also as normal or aberrant.  Finally, narratives speculate about
       an eventual transition of power to subsequent generations, especially to people who came
       of age following the 9/11 terrorist attack ("Millennials").

        Without passing judgement on the validity of the Boomers versus Millennials narrative &mdash;
        a topic debated in excruciating depth by many, many others &mdash; this project does some
        back of the envelope calculations to explore whether generational turnover might produce a
        meaningful shift in the balance of conservative versus liberal ideology in the US population
        over the next half-century. The true answer to this question is not definitively knowable
        because (a) future events and innovations can cause game-changing political and economic
        paradigm shifts, and (b) societies are complex in ways that make it difficult to understand
        exactly what causes what. However, by going through this calculation exercise,
        we can gain a better understanding of the population dynamics underlying generational
        change and how those dynamics might influence the future.
