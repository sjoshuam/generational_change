    <br><b>Death and Out-Migration: How Generations Get Smaller</b><br>

    <p>
        Since out-migration from the US is low, death is the primary way that US generations shrink
        over time.  The
        <a href='https://www.ssa.gov/oact/STATS/table4c6.html'>Social Security Administration</a>
        releases statistics on how many Americans die each year and the age at which they died.
        If we assume that future people at each age will have the same chances of dying before the
        next birthday, we can begin to project how quickly each generation's numbers will deplete
        over time.  This calculation is the basis for
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_expectancy">life expectancy</a> statistics.
        <br><br>
        The figure above charts the estimated percent of people born in a given year (a birth 
        "cohort") that will still be alive at a given age.  Move the slider bar to see the 
        estimated survival percentages for each cohort over their remaining lifetime.  Disasters,
        technological innovations, and other big societal events will change life expectancies
        over time.  So, while these figures are probably very accurate in the near term, they
        become less accurate as the projections stretch further into the future.

    <br><b>Birth and In-Migration: How Generations Get Bigger</b><br>

    <p>
    Birth and in-migration are the primary ways that US generations grow over time.  Boomer cohorts
    were especially large (the eponymous 
    "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-20th_century_baby_boom">baby boom</a>") because
    the conditions for raising a family were more conducive in the post-war West than they had been
    during WWII or the Great Depression.  Subsequent cohorts have been smaller because, world-wide,
    people in developed countries have been having fewer children (the
    "<a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographic_transition'>demographic transition</a>").
    The
    <a href="https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2023/demo/popproj/2023-summary-tables.html">Census Bureau</a>
    releases detailed population projections based on these steady trends in birth rates.
    <br><br>
    In-migration rates depend on US immigration policy &mdash; a politically contentious issue.
    If policy keeps rates low, then cohorts attain maximum size at the end of their birth year,
    and deaths steady diminishes their numbers in subsequent years.  If policy keeps rates high,
    then cohorts recoup some of these losses and stay larger for longer. For each year, the figure
    above charts the size of the cohort born in each decade.  Sizes are shown as percentages of the
    total population.  Move the sider bar to see how those sizes change with immigration policy.

    <br><b>Age and Cohort Effects: How Generations Lean Politically</b><br>

    <p>
       Combining our projections for cohort births, deaths and migration, we can make rough
       projections about the size of each cohort over time.  To the extent that numerical
       superiority translates into power, these projections tell us how much power each cohort
       may have over the political process in a given year.  But what policies and politicians
       will each cohort support with this power?
       <br><br>
       On average, older Americans lean conservative and younger Americans lean liberal.  However,
       that can either be attributed to age or cohort.  If conservatism is attributable to age,
       then today's young liberals will become tomorrow's old conservatives because the experience
       of being older inclines one to favor conservatism.  If attributable to cohort, today's
       young liberals become tomorrow's old liberals because getting older does not change their
       ideology.  Move the slider bar to see how the population percentage of liberal and
       conservative voters changes as one attributes political ideology to cohort versus age.
